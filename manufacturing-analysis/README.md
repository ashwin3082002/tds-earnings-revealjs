## 📈 Quarterly Performance Data

### 2024 Equipment Efficiency Rate by Quarter

| Quarter | Efficiency Rate | Gap to Target | Performance vs Target |
|---------|----------------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Q1 2024** | 76.99 | -13.01 | 85.5% |
| **Q2 2024** | 77.64 | -12.36 | 86.3% |
| **Q3 2024** | 76.55 | -13.45 | 85.1% |
| **Q4 2024** | 76.11 | -13.89 | 84.6% |
| **Average** | **76.82** | **-13.18** | **85.4%** |

### Key Metrics
- **Maximum Performance:** Q2 2024 at 77.64 (still 12.36 points below target)
- **Minimum Performance:** Q4 2024 at 76.11 (13.89 points below target)
- **Standard Deviation:** 0.57 (low variance indicates consistent underperformance)
- **Trend Direction:** Declining (-0.88 points from Q1 to Q4)

## 🔍 Key Findings from the Analysis

### 1. **Persistent Performance Gap**
Our equipment efficiency rate consistently hovers around **76-78**, falling short of the industry benchmark of **90** by approximately **13-14 points** every quarter. This represents a **14.6% performance deficit** compared to industry peers.

### 2. **Declining Trend**
The data shows a **negative trajectory** throughout 2024:
- Started at 76.99 in Q1
- Peaked at 77.64 in Q2
- Declined to 76.11 by Q4
- Overall decline of 0.88 points year-over-year

This declining trend suggests that current maintenance and operational practices are insufficient to maintain even the current suboptimal performance level.

### 3. **Consistent Underperformance**
No single quarter achieved:
- 80% efficiency rate (all quarters below 78)
- Even 90% of the industry target
- Any measurable improvement trajectory

The low standard deviation (0.57) indicates that the underperformance is systematic rather than sporadic, pointing to structural operational issues.

### 4. **Widening Gap in Q4**
The Q4 performance of 76.11 represents:
- The lowest efficiency rate of the year
- A 1.53 point drop from Q2 peak
- The widest gap to target (13.89 points)

This end-of-year decline is particularly concerning as it suggests accelerating deterioration.
